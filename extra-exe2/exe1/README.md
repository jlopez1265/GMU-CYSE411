# Exercise 1 – Threat Elicitation for a Support Portal

## 1. Problem Description

A company provides a web-based **Customer Support Portal** where logged-in users can create support tickets and view their ticket history.

The system identifies tickets using a simple numerical parameter in the URL:

```
https://support.example.com/ticket/view?id=1001
```

If authorization validation is missing, users may manipulate the parameter to access tickets belonging to other users.
